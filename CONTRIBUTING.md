## Code contributing

### Run tests

Run the tests using `npm test`

### Format code

We use [oxlint/oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/) (with [a lint-staged precommit](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged#readme)) to format your code automatically.

Alternatively, you can:

- trigger the pretty-printing all the files using `npm run format`
- use a [oxlint/oxfmt editor integration](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/editors.html)
